# Frontend-Portfolio-Projects
*The pinnacle of my skills is what you are watching now*

## All my frontend projects in portfolio:
- Landing - Layout of the Landing page based on the layout from Figma. This is my first experience in the layout of large pages.
- Online Shop - Layout of a large, multi-page design of an online store. I learned how to use preprocessors, semantic tags and animations.
- Fitness Trainer Landing - first independent project. The design was developed independently in Figma. Animations, various multi-layered designs were used, a mobile version was made. The site used video materials, as well as feedback forms.
- Price calculator - The first experience in creating a price calculator based on input parameters. Most of the functionality is written using jQuery. There is a PDF file generation for printing
